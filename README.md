My work from Electric City hacks 2017

# Project

The goal is to create a VR controller that has real-time 6DOF inside-out tracking, which interfaces to a web application.

The controller is a Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a Raspberry Pi Camera 1.3 module, running a visual odometry library from the Robotics and Perception Group at ETH Zurich
